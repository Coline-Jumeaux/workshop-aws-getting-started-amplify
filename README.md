# Build a simple note taking application with AWS Amplify

In this workshop, we’ll use React to build a web app that lets users create notes in a secure way.
We’ll use AWS AppSync to get up and running quickly with a GraphQL API that backs our data in Amazon DynamoDB.
In addition, we’ll demonstrate how to use the AWS Amplify library to authenticate users and communicate with our API.

Finally, we add in AI-powered object tagging using Amazon Comprehend, to allow users to get perform some sentiment analysis on the different notes.
